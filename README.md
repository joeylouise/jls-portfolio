# joeylouise portfolio site 2016

This is a portfolio site that I made for my application to Founders & Coders, when I was fairly new to coding. My favourite part is that I added a `node_modules` folder, because I'd seen it before and thought that it was something that I should add. (Note - it does not contain any node modules.) I thought about deleting the folder, but decided to leave it here because 1. It's hilarious, and 2. It reminds me how far I've come.
